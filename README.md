## Welcome to the Autoflipper!
The new graphical interface requires a bit more documentation than the last command-line based tool!

## Flipping autos
To flip an auto, follow these steps

 1. Open the root directory of your robot project with the "open project" button, the "current project" field will light up green when there are autos to flip![Step 1 image](https://github.com/09FALLDAMAGE/AutoFlipper9000/blob/main/Resources/Step1.png)
 2. Select the autos you would like to flip![Step 2 image](https://github.com/09FALLDAMAGE/AutoFlipper9000/blob/main/Resources/Step2.png)
 3. Select the axes you want to flip the autos in, keep in mind x is downfield![Step 3 image](https://github.com/09FALLDAMAGE/AutoFlipper9000/blob/main/Resources/Step3.png)
 4. Hit the flip button and follow the prompts, keep in mind that path prefixes will stack over time, so frequently renaming your paths is smart
 5. Enjoy a "free" auto for the other side, remember that both sides of the field are rarely equivalent and your tuning may not be perfect.
 ## Path Flipping
 Individual paths are now supported! Click the "Paths" tab at the top center of the window and select your paths. Paths that have been flipped will not be part of an auton and will need to be added.
 ## New - Multi Flipping
to flip multiple autos, follow the same steps as above! Just select multiple autos and hit flip
## Search bar
The search bar at the bottom isnt case sensitive. Pressing enter will search for any autos or paths that contain the contents of the search bar, pressing escape will clear the  bar and show every result again.
